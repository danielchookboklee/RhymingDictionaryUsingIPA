# RhymingDictionaryUsingIPA

Rhyming Dictionary

This is a Rhyming Dictionary that more precisely uses the IPA (International Phoentic Alphabet) to find exact rhymes based on final syllable. The top results are the most commonly used words that also rhyme with the word given by the user. A lot of fun linguistics in this code!
